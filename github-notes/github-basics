Git
    Git is the version control software that runs locally on your machine.
    You don't need to register for an account.
    You don't need the internet to use it.
    You can use Git without ever touching Github.

github
    Github is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people.
    You do need to sign up for an account to use Github. It's an online place to share work that is done using Git.



git clone <url>
    to clone a repo
    Git will retrieve all the files associated with the repository and will copy them to your local machine.
    In addition, Git initializes a new repository on your machine, giving you access to the full Git history of the cloned project.

git remote & git remote -v
    the git remote command is used to manage connections to remote repositories. It allows you to view repositories name. 
    The git remote -v option is used to display more detailed information about the remote repositories, including their URLs.

git remote add <name> <url>
    To add new remote 
    ex: git remote add origin https://github.com/astiksarathe/git-github
    Here origin is a conventional git remote name, but its not at all 
    speical, it's just a name for URL
    when you clone a github repo, the default remote name setup for us 
    is called origin. We can change it.

git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
    the git push command is used to push local changes to a remote repository.
    If that branch does not exist, it will create a new branch on the remote and push the code.
    ex: git push origin master

git push <remote> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
    While we want to push to a local branch up to a remote branch 
    of the same name. we don't have to.

    To push our local pancake branch up to remote branch called waffle
    we could do:

        git push origin pancake:waffle

git push -u <remote-name> <branch-name>
    -u: This option stands for "upstream." When you use -u followed by the remote name and branch name, it establishes a tracking relationship between your local branch and the remote branch. This means that in the future, you can simply use git push or git pull without specifying the remote name and branch name because Git remembers the association.
