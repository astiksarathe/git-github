git remote & git remote -v
    the git remote command is used to manage connections to remote repositories. It allows you to view repositories name. 
    The git remote -v option is used to display more detailed information about the remote repositories, including their URLs.

git remote add <name> <url>
    To add new remote 
    ex: git remote add origin https://github.com/astiksarathe/git-github
    Here origin is a conventional git remote name, but its not at all 
    speical, it's just a name for URL
    when you clone a github repo, the default remote name setup for us 
    is called origin. We can change it.

git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
    the git push command is used to push local changes to a remote repository.
    ex: git push origin master
