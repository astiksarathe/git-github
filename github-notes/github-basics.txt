Git
    Git is the version control software that runs locally on your machine.
    You don't need to register for an account.
    You don't need the internet to use it.
    You can use Git without ever touching Github.

github
    Github is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people.
    You do need to sign up for an account to use Github. It's an online place to share work that is done using Git.

git clone <url>
    to clone a repo
    Git will retrieve all the files associated with the repository and will copy them to your local machine.
    In addition, Git initializes a new repository on your machine, giving you access to the full Git history of the cloned project.

git remote & git remote -v
    the git remote command is used to manage connections to remote repositories. It allows you to view repositories name. 
    The git remote -v option is used to display more detailed information about the remote repositories, including their URLs.

git remote add <name> <url>
    To add new remote 
    ex: git remote add origin https://github.com/astiksarathe/git-github
    Here origin is a conventional git remote name, but its not at all 
    speical, it's just a name for URL
    when you clone a github repo, the default remote name setup for us 
    is called origin. We can change it.

git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
    the git push command is used to push local changes to a remote repository.
    If that branch does not exist, it will create a new branch on the remote and push the code.
    ex: git push origin master

git push <remote> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
    While we want to push to a local branch up to a remote branch 
    of the same name. we don't have to.

    To push our local pancake branch up to remote branch called waffle
    we could do:

        git push origin pancake:waffle

git push -u <remote-name> <branch-name> / git push --set-upstream <remote-name> <branch-name>
    -u: This option stands for "upstream." When you use -u followed by the remote name and branch name, it establishes a tracking relationship between your local branch and the remote branch. This means that in the future, you can simply use git push or git pull without specifying the remote name and branch name because Git remembers the association.

git branch -M <branch-name>
    To Change the current branch name


Remote Tracking Branches 
    It's a reference to the state of the master branch on the  remote. I can't move this myself. It's like 
    bookmark pointing to the last known commit on the master branch on origion

git branch -r
    To see the Remote Tracking Branch reference

git switch <branch-name>
    If that branch is present in GitHub but not in the local repository,
    then git switch 'branch-name' will create a new branch locally
    and sync this branch with the GitHub branch.

git fetch
    git fetch <remote>
    git fetch <remote> <branch-name>

    The git fetch <remote> command fetches branches and history from a specific remote repository. 
    it only update remote tracking branches.

    git fetch origin would fetch all changes from the origin
    remote repository.

    by default remote set as origin so if basically 
    git fetch and get fetch origin both are same

    We can fetch from specific branch as well by mentioning the branch name
    'git fetch origin master'

git pull <remote> <branch>
    'git pull origin master' would fetch the latest information
    from the origin's master branch and merge those changes into our 
    current branch

    We can directly use git pull as well then it will use origin as default remote 
    and current tracking branch 

Collaborator
    We can add Collaborator in private repo as well

README.md
    md stands for markdown

Markdown 
    It is an text to HTML conversion tool for web writers.
    Markdown allows you to write easy to read, easy to write
    plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)

Github Gist
    GitHub Gist is a feature on the GitHub platform that allows users to share code snippets, 
    small scripts, notes, or any text-based information quickly and easily. 
    Gists are essentially Git repositories but can contain single or multiple 
    files that can be either public or private.

Github Pages
    GitHub Pages is a web hosting service by GitHub for hosting static websites from repositories. 
    It supports two types of sites:

    User Sites: 
        Tied to a user's account and hosted at https://username.github.io by creating a 
        repository named <username>.github.io.
    Project Sites: 
        Associated with a repository and hosted at https://username.github.io/repositoryname, 
        typically by creating a gh-pages branch or using docs/ folder on the main branch.

Note: We can have multiple remote branches
