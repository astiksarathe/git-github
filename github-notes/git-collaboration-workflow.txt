CentraLized Workflow
    Everyone is working on a same branch (for ex: Master branch)

Features Branches 
    Rather than working on Master/Main branch, all new development 
    should be done on separate branches

Pull Request 
    A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a codebase hosted in a repository. 
    It enables collaboration in software development by allowing developers to suggest 
    modifications, have those changes reviewed, and then integrate them into the main branch. 
    The process involves forking a repository, making changes in a dedicated branch, 
    creating a request with a descriptive message, having the modifications reviewed,
    addressing feedback if needed, and ultimately merging the changes into the main codebase.

git merge --no-ff branch-name
    --no-ff => No Fast Forward

forking
    Github allow us to create personal copies of the people's
    repositories. We call those copies as "frok" of the original
    
    When we fork a repo, we're basically asking Github 
    "Make me my own copy of this repo please"
